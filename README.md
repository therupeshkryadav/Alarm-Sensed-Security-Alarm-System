# Alarm_Sensed_Security_System
In an ultrasonic security system project using Arduino Uno, ultrasonic sensors detect motion, and the Arduino processes this data to trigger actions like lighting LEDs and activating a buzzer. This setup requires connecting the ultrasonic sensor, LEDs, buzzer, and resistors to the Arduino Uno. By programming the Arduino, it interprets sensor readings, controls the LEDs, and sounds the buzzer to signal detected motion, providing a comprehensive security solution.
